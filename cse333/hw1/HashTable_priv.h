// of HTKeyValue structs.

// bucket number.

// Arguments:
// - table: the hash table to search
// - key: the key for the wanted keyvalue pair
// - remove: whether to remove the keyvalue pair once found
// - keyvaluefound: a pointer to the keyvalue pair found using the given key
//
// Returns:
//
// - true if the keyvalue pair was found, false otherwise
