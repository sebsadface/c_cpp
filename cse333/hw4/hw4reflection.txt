Questions:
1. Homework 4 forced you to follow the hypertext transfer protocol.
Describe one convenient feature (i.e., good design decision)
of this protocol in sending and receiving requests.
Describe one difficulty or annoyance you encountered with this protocol. 

Answer: 
    One convenient feature is that we don't have to worry about the previous 
    requests or responses. Each request made to the server is independent from other request. 
    This made it easy to for us to process requests from multiple clients, since we can get all
    the information we need from the current request.

    One annoyance is that since HTTP is sent in plaintext, append each line to a string while composing
    the responses, which is really error prone and can lead to sercurity issues. (We had to eacape all
    the special characters)

2. In HW4, we implemented a HTTP Server with the use of a thread pool
to concurrently handle each client connection. As discussed in lecture,
one of the biggest concerns with using threads is the need for synchronization
on shared resources, which we have done with locks. Despite threads sharing
the index and static files, we didn't have locks on these for HW4. Briefly
explain what behavior in our server made it so locks were not needed.

Answer: 
    Because we are only allowing the users to read (query results, or static files) from the shared
    resources so it is fine for multiple threads to read from the same resources. Also, each query 
    requests and static file requests are processed independently and the responses are composed
    independently within each process, so nothing gets written into the shared resources. Therefore, 
    locks were not needed
