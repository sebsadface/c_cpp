1) Use/Benefit and Equation:
Pointer Arithmetic alows us to access addresses in the memory 
easily and efficiently by treating memory as an array, and it 
gives us both the type and the size of the data.

Equation: arr[i] = *(arr + i)
arr is a pointer to arr[0], which stores the address of arr[0] 
in the memory. When we add an integer i to the pointer arr, it 
will automatically scaled by the size of the data type(e.g. 4 
for int) and add it to the pointer(e.g. assume arr = 0x00, for
an integer array arr + 1 = 0x00 + 0x01 * 4 = 0x04). This enables
us to use pointer arithmetic to traverse the array.

-----------------------------------------------------------
2) Steps:
I first let one pointer points to the first element of the array, 
and the other pointer points to the second element using pointer 
arithmetic. To get the actual difference in bytes between the two
addresses, I first cast two pointer variables to long (they have
to be of the type long, if cast them to int, we will get a warning
saying int* is being cast to a smaller value int), then subtract
the first value from the second value. We need to cast the pointers
to long integers because if we directly do subtraction on the two
pointers we will get the the integer number of the elements of a
given typec(int in this case) between the two addresses.



-----------------------------------------------------------
3) Explain:
Assume we have a function like this:

void swap_ints(int x, int y)
{
    int temp;
    temp = x;
    x = y;
    y = temp;
}

and we have int a = 1; int b = 2, we call the fundction using swap_ints(a, b)

The parameters need to both be pointers because if we use int
for the parameters, we are just passing the value of a and b 
to x and y which are stored in different addresses than a and b. 
Hence we are only swaping the value of x and y instead of a and b.
Therefore using int as parameters will not work.
